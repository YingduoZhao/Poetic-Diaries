            In 1951, a mysterious package arrived from Bavaria at the office of the President of Switzerland. 
            The package contained three black leather-bound volumes with gilt edges and clasp in which were 
            recorded chronologically dozens of poems, in the handwriting of the Empress herself. <br><br>There 
            were  also several printed copies of the material in the two earliest volumes, a few printed
            pages of the third, and a letter from Elisabeth addressed to posterity.:

            Dear future soul,
            <br><br> I entrust these documents to you. The Master dictated them to me and also determined their
            purpose, that in 60 years from the year 1890 they should be published for the benefit of political 
            prisoners and their needy dependants. For in 60 years time, just as today, there will be little 
            enough happiness and joy, that is to say freedom, on our little star. Perhaps on another? I am not 
            in a position to say these things to you today - maybe when you read these lines …….  
            <br><br>With kind regards, because I feel you love me. 
            <br><br>Titania
            <br><br>Written in the midsummer of 1890, in the hastily running special train
            </p1>
